# Dense Inference Wrapper

## Overview
An add-on to Krähenbühls DenseCRF for 3d grayscale image volumes and a corresponding python wrapper to handle numpy ndarrays.

It was designed and tested to sharpen soft-labeled classifier outputs for medical 3d image data, such as CT-volumes.

The wrapper makes it very easy to run Krähenbühls super fast DenseCRF on your classifier output (i.e. the output of your fully convolutional neural network) just by a single python method call.


This code was used in MICCAI 2016 paper ([arXiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02177)) titled :

## DenseCRF ``denseinference/lib``
The CRF-code is modified from the publicly available code by Philipp Krähenbühl and Vladlen Koltun.
See their project [website](http://www.philkr.net/home/densecrf) for more information.

If you also use this code, please cite their [paper](http://googledrive.com/host/0B6qziMs8hVGieFg0UzE0WmZaOW8/papers/densecrf.pdf):
Efficient Inference in Fully Connected CRFs with Gaussian Edge Potentials, Philipp Krähenbühl and Vladlen Koltun, NIPS 2011.

The modification is also inspired by DeepLab and its application of DenseCRF. See their project [website](https://bitbucket.org/deeplab/deeplab-public)
for more information.
